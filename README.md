# Emotion-AI

* Artificial Emotional Intelligence or Emotion AI is a branch of AI that allow computers to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions.
* Affectiva offers cutting edge emotion AI tech: https://www.affectiva.com/
* The data has more than 20000 facial images, with their associated facial expression labels and around 2000 images with their facial key-point annotations.

### PART 1. FACIAL KEY POINTS DETECTION
* create a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key-points.
* The dataset consists of x and y coordinates of 15 facial key points.
* Input Images are 96 x 96 pixels.
* Images consist of only one color channel (gray-scale images).


### PART 2. FACIAL EXPRESSION DETECTION
The second model will classify peopleâ€™s emotion.
Data contains images that belong to 5 categories:
0 = Angry
1 = Disgust
2 = Sad
3 = Happy
4 = Surprise

### PART 3. COMBINE BOTH FACIAL EXPRESSION AND KEY POINTS DETECTION MODELS
